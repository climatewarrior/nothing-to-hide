On same rare\r\noccasions it might tele-transport your computer to event\r\nhorizon. Also, this version only supports the English language, sorry :(\r\n## The Problem\r\nEmail is [not a very private method of communication.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_security#Privacy_concerns)\r\n## Current Solutions\r\nThere has been several attempts to make email more secure, like using end-to-end\r\nencryption. Some technologies, such as [GPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard) do provide great security. But this and other methods of encryption have failed to gather\r\ntraction. Without being popular, the system is not very effective since\r\nit requires all parties involved in communication to have a special\r\nsetup. Also, many of the current solutions are hard to setup and configure for many\r\nusers. Nothing to Hide tries a radically different approach to securing email.\r\n\r\n## Our Solution\r\nNothing to Hide attempts to make email more secure by making messages\r\nmore vague, in such a way that the intended recipient can still\r\nunderstand the message but snoopers can't. In it's current form, it is\r\nonly available as a [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) and [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/Home) add-on for [Gmail](https://mail.google.com). A\r\n[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) version of the add-on is on the works.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nFirst install our [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keiegjchmoggjbpgfjdjghbiicpjneoe). Also, you need the following installed:\r\n\r\n-   [Java](http://openjdk.java.net/) (Only tested with Java 7 and higher)\r\n-   [Python](http://python.org/) (Only tested with Python 2.7.x and higher)\r\n-   [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/) (Only tested with 1.4.x and higher) Learn how to install `pip` on [Windows](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750806/how-to-install-pip-on-windows) and [Mac OS X](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/). Ubuntu users can run `sudo apt-get install python-pip`.\r\n\r\n### Automated\r\nThe automated method has only been tested in GNU/Linux and Mac OS\r\nX. It should work for other Unix operating systems. Windows users have\r\nto use the manual method.\r\n\r\n####  Via Curl\r\nIf you're using `curl` type the following command:\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -L https://raw.github.com/climatewarrior/nothing-to-hide/master/utils/installer.sh | bash\r\n```\r\n#### Via Wget\r\nIf you're using `wget` type:\r\n```bash\r\nwget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/climatewarrior/nothing-to-hide/master/utils/installer.sh -O - | bash\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Manual\r\n1. Download the latest [Stanford NER](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml)\r\n2. Download the latest [Stanford Postagger](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml)\r\n3. Get extra NLTK dependencies by running `python -m nltk.downloader punkt`\r\n4. Install Flask and Pyner `pip install flask ner`\r\n5. Get the [latest version of our code](https://github.com/climatewarrior/nothing-to-hide/archive/master.zip)\r\n6. Uncompress Stanford NER and Stanford Postagger into the `abstractor-server` directory within Nothing to Hide.\r\n7. See [run.sh](https://github.com/climatewarrior/nothing-to-hide/blob/master/utils/run.sh) to learn how to start your servers manually.\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n1.  `cd` to the install directory, the default one is `~/nothing-to-hide`.\r\n2.  Start the server with: `bash utils/run.sh`.\r\n3.  Open Chrome or Chromium and open your Gmail account.\r\n4.  Write your email messages as you normally would.\r\n5.  Before sending them, hit the VAGUE-IFY button below the compose button.\r\n6.  Revise your messages. You can click on change words to bring them to their original form.\r\n7.  When you are happy with your changes click Accept on the compose window.\r\n8.  Shutdown the server whenever you wish or just leave it running in\r\n    the background.\r\n\r\n# Developer\r\n## Contributing\r\n### Building\r\n####  Dependencies\r\n\r\n-   [Pyner](https://github.com/dat/pyner)\r\n-   [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)\r\n-   [Stanford NER](https://github.com/dat/stanford-ner)\r\n-   [Stanford Tagger](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml)\r\n-   [NLTK](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nltk/2.0.1)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
